#+TITLE: GetHub README

GetHub is a Chrome extension that Displays pop-ups for new updates in
your Github NewsFeed.  

* Usage

To start using GetHub, 

  1. Install GetHub.  GetHub is currently not on the Chrome Web
     Store. You will need to clone the git repository and install the
     app as described in #4 of the *Create and load and extension*
     section in http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html
     
  2. Add your GitHub username and token to GetHub's options.  Also, set
     the frequency at which you wish to be checking for new updates. 


* TO-DO

  1. Make the Notifications "clickable". 
  2. I couldn't justify myself paying the one-time verification fee
     ($5) to Google. Might pay it, once I see more people using this.
     Sponsorship welcome. ;)
